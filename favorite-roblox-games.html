    The Mimic is a beautiful game with amazing graphics. The storyline is also really well-written, and is really emotional. Overall, I wasn't very engaged with the community, but I enjoyed seeing fanart for the game and I liked the new updates. It also doesn't have a huge learning curve and there's always a strategy for everything in every chapter of the game.

    Classic Nations is a really fun game that has many things to do in it. You can expand your country using money, participate in the oil trade, start wars against other countries, create alliances, and so much more. You can even establish your own colonial empire! This game has had me ADDICTED and it's literally so fun. 10/10 game fr.

    The Continental War 3 is an amazing game that allows for many things in it. The game is mainly about sieging territories by stepping on tiles on the map, and stopping others from sieging territories quickly by swordfighting them. The game has several gamemodes like colonization, cold war, last subcontinent standing, red vs. blue, and many others. Overall, this game is amazing and had me addicted for a long time.

    <br>

    Juke's Towers of Hell has been one of my hyperfixations for a very long time. The game is an obby game with several towers to play. These towers are then in rings, which are then in a world. World 1 has 9 rings, and World 2, has 8 zones. The towers increase in difficulty as you move further and further along. The gameplay and mechanics in these towers are super creative and I really enjoy them. 10/10 game.

    Infectious Smile is a game that holds a very special place in my heart because it's very nostalgic to me. The game was released around 2020 - 2021, when the winning smile memes on Roblox were super popular. Infectious Smile mainly combines the traits of the games based off of Changed, where there are humans and "infected" smilers. The smilers are mainly trying to infect the humans, by hugging them and infecting them with their smiles. Overall, the game is very fun and is nostalgic to me. 10/10.
