    A Dance of Fire and Ice is an amazing rhythm game and is super unique in it's nature. Instead of a VSRG where there are hit lines at the bottom of the screen where you hit the notes, you have 2 revolving planets that hit tiles to the beat. This game is insanely fun and addicting and I highly recommend that you try it out. 10/10.

    Plants vs. Zombies is a classic game from the early 2010s. The main objective is simple: place plants down on your garden using sun energy to attack the zombies and stop them from entering your home. This gameplay is then twisted in many of it's different worlds that it has. Overall, PVZ is a really fun game. 10/10 game.

    64.0, similarly to A Dance of Fire and Ice, takes a unique approach to rhythm that many games don't adopt. It uses bullets you can use to shoot at the "bad guys" to the rhythm, and let the good guys in. Overall, it's very unique and fun. 10/10 game overall.

    Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is also a horror game that follows the player through a mansion of 1000 doors. Every 50 doors, theres an elevator that takes you to another floor of the mansion. Each door has something new, whether it be a monster, puzzle, or a regular room. Overall, this game is amazing and had me wondering what was to come next. 10/10 game.
